This project is about the overall coffeebean sales analysis and converting the dataset into meaningful visualisation.
Funtions used such as:

1.xlookup

2.index match

3.multiple IF statements

4.Pivot table : 
  1. total sales overtime
  2. sales by country 3.top 5 customers

Step-by-Step Process for an Excel Data Analysis Project:
1. Define Project Objectives
Clearly outline the goals of your analysis (e.g., identifying sales trends, creating dashboards, etc.).
For example, in the Coffee Sales Analysis project, the aim was to improve sales forecasting accuracy by uncovering key insights.
2. Collect and Import Data
Obtain the dataset (e.g., sales records, customer information, etc.).
Import the data into Excel, either manually or by connecting to external sources like CSV, SQL databases, or APIs.
3. Data Cleaning and Preparation
Identify issues: Handle missing values, duplicates, and incorrect formats.
Transform data: Normalize columns, split/merge cells, and ensure consistency.
Example techniques:
Use Text to Columns for splitting data.
Apply Find & Replace to correct formatting errors.
Filter out unnecessary rows/columns to focus on relevant information.
4. Data Analysis
Apply Excel formulas and functions to calculate metrics (e.g., totals, averages, percentages).
Use PivotTables for summarizing data by different dimensions (e.g., sales by product or month).
Example for Coffee Sales Analysis:
Calculate monthly revenue: =SUMIFS(Sales, Month, "January").
Identify the top-selling product using the RANK or SORT function.
5. Visualization
Use charts and graphs to visualize trends and relationships:
Bar charts: Sales by product or region.
Line charts: Seasonal sales trends.
Pie charts: Proportion of product categories.
Dynamic dashboards can be created using slicers, conditional formatting, and linking charts to PivotTables.
6. Build Dashboards
Create interactive dashboards for stakeholders:
Combine tables, charts, and slicers in one sheet.
Use visual design principles: clear labels, appropriate colors, and concise titles.
7. Derive Insights
Analyze the visuals and summaries to generate actionable recommendations.
Example: If sales peak during holidays, suggest increasing inventory or marketing campaigns in those months.
